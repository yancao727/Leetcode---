<p align="center">Figure 5. Compare Jobs Interface (left) and two jobs are selected for further comparison (right) </p>

These jobs are ranked from best to worst by using a job score, which is computed as the weighted sum of: 
**`AYS + ASB + AYB + (RBP * AYS) + (LT * AYS / 260)`**

where: 

```
AYS = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
ASB = signing bonus adjusted for cost of living
AYB = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
RBP = retirement benefits percentage
LT = leave time
```

For example, if the weights are `2` for the `yearly salary`, `2` for the `retirement benefits`, and `1` for all other factors, the score would be computed as:\
`2/7 * AYS + 1/7 * ASB + 1/7 * AYB + 2/7 * (RBP * AYS) + 1/7 * (LT * AYS / 260)`

If you wish to compare two jobs in details, check the boxes on the right (Figure 5 right), and click on the `COMPARE OFFERS` button at the bottom of the Compare Jobs Interface. You will be directed to the Compare Two Jobs Interface. 

<p align="center">

In this compare two jobs interface, you will be shown a table comparing the two jobs displaying all the details for each job. If you wish to perform another comparison, click `back` and reselect two new jobs.
